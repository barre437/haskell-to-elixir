# haskell-to-elixir
Conversion of Haskell code to Elixir.

Haskell Code is from the book Computational Semantics with Functional Programming by Jan van Eijck and Christina Unger. 

Haskell Code hosted on computational-semantics.eu .

Final project for LING 4195: Linguistics Special Topics: Computational Semantics @ the University of Minnesota Duluth, Instructor: Chongwon Park

After spending a semester programming in Haskell along with the aforementioned book, a valuable final programming project was mutually agreed upon. The purpose is to convert the files from chapters 4, 5, 6, & 7 from Haskell into Elixir. Completion of such will demonstrate understanding of both languages and a wider breadth of knowledge using functional programming.
